## Combining human judgment and data-driven approaches for the development of interpretable models of student behaviors: Applications to computer science education (2020–2024)

{{< figure src="/images/research/CAREER-fig.png" class="research-image">}}

This NSF-funded project contributes to the state of the art in the modeling of student behaviors in digital learning environments by formalizing a hybridized approach that generates models that are both interpretable by non-experts and robust to the noisiness of human behavior data. It combines knowledge elicitation approaches—which use human experts to develop interpretable models and to filter out noisy information—with data-driven approaches using machine learning algorithms which are often able to discover relationships that are difficult for human experts to explicate. This hybridized approach is applied in the context of computer science education, leveraging the increased interpretability of the models it creates to (1) better understand student debugging behaviors during programming activities, (2) support students in self-reflecting about the strategies they use and develop more efficient debugging strategies, (3) provide instructors with actionable information about their students’ debugging activities and (4) support future computer science teacher in acquiring expertise related to formulating hypotheses about a student’s debugging strategies.
