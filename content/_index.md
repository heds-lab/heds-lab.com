## Welcome!

The Human-centered Educational Data Science (HEDS) Lab is housed at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) and is led by [Dr. Luc Paquette](https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/luc-paquette). Our mission is to advance the work of educational data science through rigorous research that leverages the latest advances in machine learning while keeping people front and center. We do this by combining human expert-based modeling with data-informed analyses and by focusing first on human-interpretable modeling techniques.
